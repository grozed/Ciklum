We need a CI/CD pipeline that does the following:

Git for version control
A tool for a build service
A tool to manage an audited and authorized deployment service
Please describe how you would chain these tools into a pipeline that can handle developers testing, developing, building and deploying their work.

First of all, we need to decide which tool are we goint to follow to create the CICD. IÂ´m my case, I will se Jenkins, but could be others, like Octupus or GitLab CI tools. 

In this pipeline creation, in the configuration parameters, we should select a remote git repository to checkout where are we going to need to automatically redeploy. This git repository could be from bitbucket, github or the repository tecnology are you using. 

Then, we can start to create a groovy pipeline. I suponse we are going to deploy the others python task I did it on the others task. Probably I will dockerize them and add a rest API so we can comunicate and call the functions. 

I will only use the automatics deploy on jenkins for test deploy, adding unitary test. To deploy to a production environment, I will use a VPN to connect to a remote machine with credentials to run a script for deploy purpose, or a small web to manually deploy. Or add it another jenkins server with no automation deploy and more secure option to manually deploy.
